# skynet-portal-racer
Race portals to see which one can resolve your skylinks the fastest

## Build yourself?
Simply run 
```
npm install
parcel build index.html --public-url .
```
The result will build all files into a single `index.html` which will be in the
`dist` folder. If you upload that to your portal of choice, you have your own
race app.
